                <p>Home maintenance has its challenges! What if we could make home maintenance tasks easier and
                    provide an organized home system all in one? In this project, I worked with a team to develop a home
                    maintenance app to empower overwhelmed homeowners. </p>

                <p>Impactful nonprofits don’t always have the digital representation they deserve. In this project, I
                    worked with a team to transform the user experience
                    digitally for this nonprofit by redesigning their website to allow for users to better access the
                    many resources available to them.

                    beverage right from your wrist? In this project,
                    I had fun envisioning the process of ordering a cup of coffee from my favorite coffee shop on an
                    Apple Watch.

                <h2>User Experience</h2>
                <p>Getting to know the users for each individual project is an intensive and fun process. I enjoy
                    conducting interviews and taking
                    a moment to connect with users and identify their needs through active listening and observations.

                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>Taking the needs of the user and designing possible solutions on paper or as digital wireframes is a
                    skill I enjoy. Personally,
                    I like to sketch out ideas on paper first, then use Figma or XD to add more structure to the
                    wireframes as they increase in fidelity.

                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                <p>When it comes to putting the users flow into action, prototyping the wireframes together is really
                    exciting! I enjoy making those
                    connections and seeing how the design comes to life.
